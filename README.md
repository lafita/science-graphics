# Science-Graphics
Collection of R scripts to generate common science figures.
The purpose of this repository is to provide nicely formatted figures by DEFAULT directly from the corresponding data table. Note that each plot is very specific for a type of analysis or purpose.

Some of the supported scientific figures are:
- Variable Evolution
  - ODEs
  - MonteCarlo Simulations
- Variable Distributions
  - Histograms
  - Density
- Benchmarking
  - Multi-class Classification
  - ROC Curves
  - Precision-Recall Curves
